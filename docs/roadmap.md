## 9. Roadmap: Charting the Course for Yeap Finance

Yeap Finance’s development and rollout are planned in distinct, iterative phases. This roadmap is a living document, subject to adaptation.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Launch (Current Focus/Near Term)

* **[✓] Core Protocol Development**: Vaults, IBTs, initial IRMs, foundational Borrow Protocols (Position, basic Leveraged LP, Flashloan) in Move.
* **[✓] Security Audits**: Initial comprehensive audits by reputable firms.
* **[->] Incentivized Testnet Deployment & Community Feedback Loop**:
    * Public testnet with core functionalities (Leveraged LP, margin trading).
    * Faucet, basic frontend.
    * *GTM Element*: Engage power users, gather feedback, run incentivized testing.
* **[ ] Mainnet Launch (Minimal Viable Product - MVP)**:
    * Audited core contracts on a target Move-based mainnet.
    * Initial whitelisted assets and LP tokens.
    * Permissionless vault creation for supported assets.
    * User-friendly dApp interface.
    * *GTM Element*: Coordinate with L1/L2 foundation, target initial liquidity from community.
    * *Initial Liquidity Strategy*: Attractive initial APYs, subsidized rates/rewards for key features.
* **[ ] Community Building & Comprehensive Early Documentation**:
    * Establish active community channels.
    * Publish user guides, tutorials, developer docs, FAQs.
    * *GTM Element*: Content marketing focused on capital efficiency, leveraged LPing, margin trading.

### Phase 2: Expansion & Feature Enrichment (Next 6-12 Months Post-MVP)

* **Enhanced Leveraged LP Token Protocol**:
    * Support for wider range of LP types (concentrated liquidity, structured products).
    * Full single-asset collateral initiation for LP leverage.
    * Broader DEX integrations, advanced LP oracles.
    * Sophisticated risk management tools for leveraged LP positions.
    * Support for borrowing *both* underlying assets.
    * **Automated/semi-automated rebalancing for Leveraged LP positions.**
* **Advanced Interest Rate Models**: Introduce 'kink' models, oracle-influenced models. Tools for IRM simulation.
* **New Standardized Borrow Protocols**: E.g., basic NFT Collateral Loans, Fixed-Term Loans. *GTM: Developer bounties, partnerships.*
* **Broader Asset Support & Enhanced Oracle Integrations**: More oracles, streamlined process for new asset proposals.
* **Governance Framework V1 (If $YEAP Token is Introduced)**: Token launch, initial on-chain governance. *GTM: Airdrop campaign.*
* **Developer Ecosystem Growth & Support**: SDKs, developer tools, grants program. *GTM: Hackathons, workshops.*
* **Cross-Chain Asset Exploration & Initial Bridging**: Research and prototyping for bridged assets.

### Phase 3: Advanced Functionality & Ecosystem Maturity (12-24 Months Post-MVP)

* **Advanced DeFi Integrations & Composability**: IBTs as collateral elsewhere, vaults interacting with external yield sources.
* **Undercollateralized Lending Solutions (Research Intensive Phase)**: Exploring models with decentralized identity, reputation systems.
* **Cross-Chain Vaults & True Interoperability (Full-Scale, if Securely Feasible)**: Native cross-chain lending/borrowing.
* **Enhanced DAO Tooling & Governance V2**: Sophisticated dashboards, delegation, complex proposals, mature treasury management.
* **Real-World Asset (RWA) Integration**: Frameworks for tokenized RWAs. *GTM: Target RWA projects, tokenization platforms.*
* **Continuous Focus on Scalability, Efficiency, and Cost Reduction**.
* **Decentralized Frontend Hosting & Community Frontends**.

### Ongoing Throughout All Phases:

* **Unwavering Commitment to Security**: Continuous audits, bug bounties, risk monitoring.
* **Deep Community Engagement**: Feedback, discussions, transparent updates, community support.
* **Comprehensive and Up-to-Date Documentation**.
* **Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystem Building**.

This roadmap underscores Yeap Finance's commitment to sustained innovation, robust security, and community-driven growth.
